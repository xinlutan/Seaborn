# Seaborn Data Visualization
In SeabornNotebook.ipynb, I put together a summary of Seaborn plots for visualizing univariate, bivaritate and multivariate relationship, using examples collected from https://seaborn.pydata.org/index.html.  I included the dataset used for illustration in the same folder, so this notebook is self-contained.
